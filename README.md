[![Built with Lovable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Lovable-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=love)](https://lovable.dev)

Welcome to Mystic Forge, an idle game where you harness the power of mana to build a powerful engine of production. Start with a single click and grow your empire to forge the ultimate artifact: the Cosmic Resonator.

## Goal of the Game

The primary objective is to progress through the game by generating resources, purchasing items and upgrades, and ultimately crafting the **Cosmic Resonator**, which marks the completion of the main game. After that, you can continue to play, pushing your prestige level ever higher.

## Core Features

-   **Resource Generation:** Click to generate Mana, then purchase automated items to generate it for you.
-   **Multi-Currency System:** Manage Mana, Cogwheel Gears, Research Points, and more as you progress.
-   **Deep Upgrade Tree:** Unlock hundreds of upgrades for your items and global production.
-   **Workshop & Research:** Invest in your workshop and research new technologies for powerful boosts.
-   **Prestige System (Dimensional Shift):** Reset your progress to earn Aether Shards, which are used to purchase powerful, permanent upgrades that persist across resets.
-   **Overclocking:** Push your Cogwheel Gear production to the limit, at a cost!
-   **Offline Progress:** Your forge continues to work even when you're away.
-   **Auto-Buyers:** Unlock the ability to automate purchasing items and upgrades.
-   **Save Management:** Your game is saved automatically. You can also manually export and import your save file.
-   **Victory Condition:** A clear end-goal with a satisfying conclusion and a final credits screen.

## How to Play

1.  **Click the Mana Orb:** Start by generating Mana manually.
2.  **Buy Items:** Purchase your first `Mana Spring` to start automatic Mana generation.
3.  **Purchase Upgrades:** As you unlock them, buy upgrades to boost your items' production.
4.  **Unlock New Tiers:** Reaching certain milestones will unlock new items, currencies, and mechanics like the Workshop and Research.
5.  **Prestige:** When you've amassed enough power, perform a `Dimensional Shift` to reset for Aether Shards and unlock powerful permanent upgrades.
6.  **Win!** Build your way up to forging the `Cosmic Resonator`.
