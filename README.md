[![Built with Lovable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Lovable-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=love)](https://lovable.dev)

Welcome to Mystic Forge, a feature-rich idle game where you harness the power of mana to build a powerful engine of production. Start with a single click and grow your empire through multiple prestige layers, deep upgrade systems, and challenging new game modes to forge the ultimate artifact: the Cosmic Resonator.

## Goal of the Game

The primary objective is to progress through the game by generating resources, purchasing items and upgrades, and ultimately crafting the **Cosmic Resonator**, which marks the completion of the main game. After that, you can continue to play, pushing your prestige level ever higher, completing difficult challenges, and unlocking powerful dimensional upgrades in an expansive post-game.

## Core Features

-   **Multi-Currency System:** Manage Mana, Cogwheel Gears, Research Points, Aether Shards, and more as you progress.
-   **Deep Upgrade Tree:** Unlock hundreds of upgrades for your items and global production.
-   **Workshop & Research:** Invest in your workshop and research new technologies for powerful boosts.
-   **Prestige System (Dimensional Shift):** Reset your progress to earn Aether Shards, used to purchase powerful, permanent upgrades.
-   **Dimensional Challenges:** Test your skills in 9 unique challenges that alter the game's rules, earning tokens for permanent rewards.
-   **Essence Golems:** Build and customize up to 3 Golems to create powerful synergistic bonuses tailored to your strategy.
-   **Achievements:** Unlock over 80 achievements that reward you with a permanent production bonus for all resources.
-   **Offline Progress:** Your forge continues to work for up to 24 hours when you're away.
-   **Save Management:** Your game is saved automatically. You can also manually export and import your save file.
-   **Victory Condition:** A clear end-goal with a satisfying conclusion and a final credits screen, plus a robust post-game.
